Capstone Project by Richa Arora and Kate Fulton:

An application for Northwest Immigrant Rights Project (NWIRP).

It's a case management app where NWIRP staff can enter information about clients who have criminal convictions.
And then that data can be queried in a variety of ways.
The goal is for NWIRP to better understand how certain convictions play out with people's immigration cases--for example if certain convictions tend to have particularly harsh immigration consequences for individuals.
Then, with this data, NWIRP and other organizations that they work with can provide more accurate information about these consequences when public defenders are negotiating plea deals.
The hope is that this data will help eliminate and/or mitigate immigration consequences for non-citizens, or at the very least help accurately inform individuals of the immigration consequences they will most likely face.

The business requirements:
* Create, edit, and store information about Northwest Immigrant Rights Project (NWIRP) clients who have criminal convictions
* Allow flexible queries for users to search the data
* Better understand how certain convictions play out with people's immigration cases
* Provide more accurate information about these consequences when public defenders are negotiating plea deals
* Time tracking for each case to understand the time taken to better manage the timelines moving forward

Implementation:
* Database: PgSQL
* Domain Tables that ensure the quality of database
* Overwriting Primary Keys help simplify an already complex query system
* Two Simple Forms that contain multiple models
* One Advanced Query Page that dynamically changes to fit userâ€™s needs and allows them to search clients or convictions
* Client can save queries by name and also export the results in Excel
* Encryption of sensitive data using two point decryption
* Admin dashboard for approving users and maintaining domain tables
